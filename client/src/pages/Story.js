            My name is Raquel Flores, and I enjoy cooking and spending time with family and friends.  
            It all started when I was a little girl and had a Holly Hobbie Playhouse with a kitchen, stove, and refrigerator. 
            To this day I am a firm believer that the best way to spend time together with family and friends is with food.   
            I cook traditional Puerto Rican meals every Easter, Thanksgiving, and Christmas. 
            For example, I make <i>arroz con gandules,</i> empanadas, plantains, stew beef with potatoes, and <i>pasteles.</i>
            The one thing that everyone enjoys is the empanadas.  
            They are always a big hit, and 
            I always bring them to my family and friend's events. They can never get enough!
            One day a friend asked me if she could buy two dozen, but I had never thought about selling them.  
            Since that day, I began Mamasita's Empanadas.
            Itâ€™s amazing how quickly the word got around about my empanadas. 
            I feel truly blessed to be able to share my Spanish tradition with everyone around me.   
            Food tastes better when you share it with the people you love.               </p>
